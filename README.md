## Hi there, I'm Mike Bu ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¼ My current job is a Data Engineer at Cargill. My work focuses on implementing platform governance for data lineage and data architecture.
  
- ðŸ“– I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science from Georgia Tech as a part-time student, in parallel with my current job. My studies focus on the Artificial Intelligence specialization, as I learn about artificial intelligence principles and implement them in my career.

- ðŸŽ“ I received my Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering from the University of Georgia.

- ðŸŒ± My highlight project from my portfolio is an [IQ Test Solver](https://www.github.com/mikezbu/Computer_Vision), I'm developing an AI Agent that can solve [Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) - these questions are similar to problems on an IQ Test. This project focuses on building an intelligent system capable of solving visual reasoning puzzles by identifying patterns, scaling shapes, and addressing overlapping elements in images. It demonstrates my expertise in computer vision techniques and machine learning.
