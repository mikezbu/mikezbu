## Hi there, I'm Mike Bu ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ *I'm actively seeking a new career opportunity in data science, data engineering, data analytics, or data consulting! Feel free to reach out!*

- ðŸ’¼ My current job is as a Data Scientist at the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO). My work focuses on implementing data science projects such as data management and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the functioning and regulation of nuclear power plants across the United States.

- ðŸ“– I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science from Georgia Tech as a part-time student. My studies focus on the Machine Learning specialization, as I learn about artificial intelligence principles and implement them in my career.

- ðŸŽ“ I received my Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering from the University of Georgia.

- ðŸŒ± For my project portfolio, I'm creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) chat bot to add to my [music collector's website](https://www.github.com/mikezbu/album_global). The purpose of this is to help the user search and recommend a music album based on the user's music preferences.
